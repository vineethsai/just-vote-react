        <h2>Topic Description</h2>
        <p>For my project, I hope to create a web application that works as some sort of volunteer opportunity search,
            almost
            like an Indeed or Glassdoor for community service. Throughout my own life, I have been an avid volunteer
            but have
            sometimes struggled to find volunteer positions that I was passionate about and/or that I could feasibly
            fit into my
            schedule. This is a problem many may face, most notably high school students who need to complete community
            service
            to graduate or currently unemployed people who are looking for something meaningful to do with their time.</p>
        <p>Many organizations are also in desperate need of volunteers in order to operate but may not have the
            resources to
            actively recruit volunteers. This may especially be the case for new non-profit organizations that do not
            have the clout
            of larger organizations, such as a local hospital or national non-profit such as the Red Cross, but still
            needs volunteer
            help in order to survive. Giving your time is arguably more important that giving your money, so giving
            people easy ways
            to find a cause they are passionate about will allow more people to give back to their communities.</p>
        <p>Of course, non-profits do not only need volunteers, but they also need donations. This site could also
            provide people
            information about organizations that might work for causes that the user supports, such as donation links,
            future
            fundraisers, and similar organizations. This would make the application serve as a “one stop shop” for
            those interested
            in both working for and giving to charities.</p>

        <h2>Potential Applications</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>A ‘search engine’ for volunteer opportunities</dt>
            <dd>Similar to sites such as Indeed, the user can enter in parameters such as time commitment, needed
                certifications,
                location, etc. in order to find volunteer opportunities. This function would be especially helpful for
                people who
                already know what space they’d like to work in.</dd>
            <dt>A quiz that matches people to volunteer opportunities</dt>
            <dd>This quiz would ask you questions about available time, causes you find interesting, skills you
                possess,
                certifications you currently have, and previous organizations you’ve worked for in order to give you a
                list of 5-10
                custom suggestions for organizations you may want to volunteer with. This function would be helpful for
                people who
                would like to give their time, but don’t know exactly what type of work they would like to do or what
                causes peak
                their interests.</dd>
            <dt>A map of local fundraisers</dt>
            <dd>This map would give people information about fundraisers occurring in a specified time range in a
                specified area.
                These fundraisers may need volunteers, or they may be a good opportunity for someone to learn more
                about a new
                organization and potentially donate their money. This option would be helpful for people who may not
                have enough
                time to regularly volunteer but would like to help out on a one time basis, either with their time or
                money.</dd>
