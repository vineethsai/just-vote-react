Weve got great weather, a fine University, a vibrant community, and access to all sorts of leisure activities, but did you know that were also home to one of the best community orchestras in the Midwest? Now in its 47th season, the Bloomington Symphony Orchestra is one of Bloomingtons most enduring arts organizations.We go to your concerts for more than the great music. We go because of the human touch and artistry that takes us in more mature, more profound directions. Audience feedback 5/3/15Praised for its innovative programming, the all-volunteer Bloomington Symphony Orchestra performs ten concerts per season. From light-hearted holiday pops shows and childrens concerts to the great masterpieces of orchestral music, our programs educate, enlighten, and entertain audiences of every age and background.Peter Jacobi of the Herald-Times calls the Bloomington Symphony Orchestra a gift to the community.Educational Outreach  Did you know that the Bloomington Symphony provides educational outreach to area children?   Childrens Instrument Recovery Program (ChIRP) loans instruments to at-risk families so their children can participate in their school music programs.   Meet the Instruments lets youngsters try all the instruments of the orchestra  from trombones to snare drums to cellos - and get excited about making music for the very first time.   Side-by-Side Concerts pair high school students with orchestral mentors as they prepare and perform major orchestral works.Youth Concerto Competition provides talented high school students with scholarships and a chance to play as a soloist with the orchestra. Violinist Joshua Bell was one of our first winners!  Innovative Programming  One of the things the BSO has worked towards in recent years is to enhance the traditional concert experience, creating more of an event than what most people would envision for a typical orchestral performance. Not that theres anything wrong with a traditional concert experience  weve just found that our audiences appreciate the sort of enrichment this approach can provide.We find ways to be innovative and make each concert memorable, while still maintaining high musical standards, and playing the great orchestral pieces our musicians love to work on. This has led us to experiment with new partnerships  both with other arts organizations, but also stretching ourselves for things like 2015s COSMOS, where we worked with two faculty members from the IU Astronomy Department to present a multi-media performance of Gustav Holsts The Planets.A Brief History  The Bloomington Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1969 by Indiana University conducting graduate student Geoffrey Simon. Concerned about the lack of performance opportunities for the people of Bloomington, Simon requested permission from the Dean of the IU School of Music, Wilfred Bain, to form a community orchestra. Simon envisioned an orchestra open to all serious musicians, regardless of their vocations.",-86.531389,39.14621

The program that we used to help the families was called Monroe County Toys for Tots and we have helped thousands of children and families from Monroe County and surrounding areas. This program was used for the last 41 years. Unfortunately we had to close Monroe County Toys for Tots down because we were told that we were infringing on the Marine Corps foundations copy write material. So what we have done is change our name to Christmas for the Kids Inc. We are a 501c3 and are only looking for your help to raise the necessary funds to provide the kids with the toys so they will not have to go with out during this Holiday Season. The name may have changed but the program is the same. You can help me make a difference with your help we can continue to help the families in need enjoy their Holiday Season hopefully like all of us do. PLEASE HELP US MAKE A DIFFERENCE. Together we can do it.  Thank you for your helpBob,-86.515572,39.134674
