            <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>Here at Helping Hands, we want to make the world a better place for everyone to live in. Whether that
                means protecting the health of the planet, feeding the homeless, or educating our youth, we find all
                work important. And we want to connect you to that important work. But, finding meaningful volunteer
                work or charities can be extremely difficult. Our schedules are packed, our resources limited, but our
                hearts are full. The staff at Helping Hands prides ourselves in connecting people to volunteer
                opportunities and charities they will find fulfilling and meaningful.

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>Volunteering has always played a large role in my life. When I was an infant, my mother took a job at a
                nonprofit, and I have been helping her with her work for as long as I can remember. In elementary
                school, my Girl Scout troop would go help out at local soup kitchens. When I entered high school, my
                teachers placed a heavy focus on volunteer work, and I began to do more unpaid work than paid work. In
                high school, I volunteered at several organizations, most involving education of some sort, because
                that's where I found one of my passions. I have found some of my most meaningful volunteer work through
                outside reccomendations, and that's the service I hope the website will provide. If you live in the
                Seattle area and enjoy educating, think about some of the following locations, as they happen to have
                provided me my favorite experiences while volunteering:</p>

                    <p><strong>Seattle Children's Stanley Stamm Summer Camp</strong>: Stamm Camp has started to
                        feel more like home to me than Seattle. For one week, 300 volunteers take 100 children to
                        overnight camp, all of whom have chronic disabilities that prevent them from attending
                        other area camps. During the week of camp, they get to ride horses, catch fish (which they
                        get to take home with them), swim, make arts and crafts, and shoot bows and arrows, all
                        free of charge. More information <a href="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/clinics/stanley-stamm-summer-camp/">here.</a></p>

                    <p><strong>Team Read</strong>: By fourth grade, your reading potential becomes set in stone.
                        If children aren't up to reading level by the end of third grade, they will never catch up
                        with their peers and are therefore more likely to drop out of high school. Team Read's
                        mission is to make sure every child knows how to read before fourth grade. They pair local
                        high school students with one child who needs some extra help, and they work one on one
                        with them once a week for the whole year. Find out more <a href="http://teamread.org/">here.</a></p>
